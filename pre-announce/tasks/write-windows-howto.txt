Write a "Using Python on Windows" document.
"""

description = """
We have a document on using Python on the Mac at

   http://docs.python.org/dev/using/mac.html

An equivalent thing for Windows would be great. That section should
contain, roughly, information how to install Python on Windows, how
to configure it, how to invoke it, what the essential packages and
programs for working with Windows are, what extra things and quirks
you should know about.

Collect this information (it is likely to be found at several sources
on the Internet) and write it into a document similar to the existing
Mac one.

See the DocumentationAndExampleGuidelines and WorkingOnDocumentation wiki
pages for helpful information, under

   http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-psf/w/list

Completion:

Attach the result file(s) to this task, and send a brief description of your
document to the ghop-python mailing list.
