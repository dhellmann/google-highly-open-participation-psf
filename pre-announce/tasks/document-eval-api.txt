summary = """
Document the PyEval_* C API functions in the C API Reference.
"""

description = """
There are several public C API functions (mostly in Python/ceval.c) which are
not documented in the API reference document at

  http://docs.python.org/dev/c-api

Collect them (their names all begin with "PyEval_"), find out what they
do (which is quite trivial in most cases) and add an appropriate paragraph
to the API documentation.

Completion:

Attach the results of an 'svn diff' (context diff) against the Python
source tree to this task, and send a brief description of your changes
to the ghop-python mailing list.
