Find new terms for the Python documentation's glossary and cross-link them

description = """

The Python documentation for 2.6 and 3.0 has a glossary which aims to
explain common, Python-specific or otherwise important terms used in
the documentation.

See http://docs.python.org/dev/glossary.html for the 2.6 glossary.

Look at the glossary and decide which additional terms would be good
to explain here. Explain them in one or two sentences, maybe referring
to other glossary entries in turn.

Then, search through the rest of the documentation for the new terms
and, where appropriate, add a ":term:" role to them in order to create
a link to the glossary.

See the DocumentationAndExampleGuidelines and WorkingOnDocumentation wiki
pages for helpful information, under
