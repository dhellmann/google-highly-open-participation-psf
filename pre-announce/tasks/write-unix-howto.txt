Write a "Using Python on Unix platforms" document.
"""

description = """
We have a document on using Python on the Mac at

   http://docs.python.org/dev/using/mac.html

An equivalent thing for Unix platforms (Linux etc.) would be great.
That section should contain, roughly, information how to install
Python on these platforms (that should be a short overview
and otherwise a pointer to the README document), how to configure it,
how to invoke it, what the essential packages and programs for working
with Unix platforms are, what extra things and quirks you should know about.

Collect this information (it is likely to be found at several sources
on the Internet) and write it into a document similar to the existing
Mac one.

Completion:

Attach the result file(s) to this task, and send a brief description of your
document to the ghop-python mailing list.

Relevant wiki pages:

 - DocumentationAndExampleGuidelines
 - WorkingOnDocumentation
