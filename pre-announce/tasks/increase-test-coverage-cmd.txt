summary = """
Add unit tests for the 'cmd' module in Python 2.6.
"""

description = """
Measure the number of lines executed by the unit tests included with
Python 2.6 for the 'cmd' module, using figleaf or coverage (see
MeasuringCodeCoverage).  Add new tests that increase the code coverage
for this module to greater than 60%.  Submit a context diff (see
SubmittingPatches) and text or HTML files containing both the old and
new test coverage results.

There appear to be no tests for 'cmd' currently in the Python source
tree, so you will need to start from scratch.  Ask for help if you
need a starting point.

Completion:

Attach the results of an 'svn diff' (context diff) against the Python
source tree to this task. Also include a brief description of the
changes you've made.
