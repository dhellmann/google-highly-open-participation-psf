summary = """
Update 'str', 'unicode', and 'bytes' references in the docs.
"""

description = """

In Python 3.0, unicode has been removed, because all strings are now
unicode. Byte strings are now 'bytes'.  (See "Atomic Types" in PEP
3100, http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3100/, and PEP 3137).

Update the library documentation for Py3K appropriately.
