Update the Py3K docs to match PEP 3100, Core Language Changes.
"""

description = """
PEP 3100 documents most of the Python 3.0 plans.  While most of the
core language changes have been made, the documentation does not reflect
all of them.  Go over the Python 3.0 docs,

    http://docs.python.org/dev/3.0/

and make a list of all of the places that describe behavior incompatible
with Python 3.0.  Then update the documentation appropriately.
