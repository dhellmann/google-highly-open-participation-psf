Benchmark a new memory allocation scheme, TCMalloc.
"""

description = """
Replace the existing malloc- and pymalloc-based schemes with TCMalloc,

    http://goog-perftools.sourceforge.net/doc/tcmalloc.html 

and use pybench (Tools/pybench/pybench.py in Subversion) to assess the
results.

Run pybench for either Python 2.6 or Python 3.0, under four different
configurations of Python:

 - default pymalloc-based system ('configure')

 - with pymalloc disabled ('configure --without-pymalloc')

 - with pymalloc disabled and with TCMalloc enabled (see TCMalloc docs);

 - with pymalloc enabled with TCMalloc enabled.

Do this for either Python 2.6 or Python 3.0; summarize the reports and
send them to ghop-psf mailing list.
