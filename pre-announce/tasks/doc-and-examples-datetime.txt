description = """
Add documentation and examples to the 'datetime' module in the Python 2.6
standard library.

See DocumentationAndExampleGuidelines for general information on
getting the latest docs, editing them, and generating patches.

Details for this specific module:

 - write an additional set of examples by adding code examples
   (and discussion) showing:

  * the use of timedelta objects, along with +/-, //, and abs() on
    timedeltas;

  * the use of date objects, including fromtimestamp, fromordinal,
    replace, timetuple, isocalendar, isoformat, and strftime;

  * the use of datetime objects, including combine, strptime, astimezone,
    timetuple, isocalendar, and strftime;

  * the use of time objects, including dst and tzname;

  * the use of tzinfo objects;

  * the use of strftime, with a number of examples showing the use of the
    various % codes from the 'time' module.

  * also, import the full set of codes from the 'time' module into the
    strftime section.

Extra credit if the examples are all doctests!
