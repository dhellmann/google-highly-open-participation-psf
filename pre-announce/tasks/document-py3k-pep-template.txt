Update the Py3K docs with changes from PEP @@.

description = """
Many of the Python Enhancement Proposals (PEP) for Py3K, numbered 31xx,
have been accepted and implemented (see the PEP index, "Finished PEPs",

     http://www.python.org/dev/peps/

for a full list).  However, the changes in the code are not yet
reflected in the Python docs.  Read and understand the PEP, locate the
places in the docs that need to be updated, and update them to reflect
the changes in the PEP.

Reminder: working code examples are an excellent way to make sure that
you understood the PEP ;)
