Write a *simple* tutorial introduction to the BeautifulSoup parser,

http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/

Take a fairly simple page (e.g. reddit.com, or www.python.org) and 
write a tutorial introduction that shows how to use BeautifulSoup
to extract each type of information from the page, including:

 - title
 - links
 - div information
 - form information

This could eaisly be done by extracting elements from the existing
BeautifulSoup docs, here:
