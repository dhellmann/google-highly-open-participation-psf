# Build on Windows #

Author: Titus Brown

One other random idea I had last night: build Windows versions of
various 3rd-party packages for multiple versions of Python, including
Python3k.  Unfortunately at the moment I think this relies on $$
software, but perhaps students will already own that (or at least their
schools may).
