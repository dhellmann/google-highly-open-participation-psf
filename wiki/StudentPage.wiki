= Introduction =

Welcome to the GHOP contest, and welcome to Python!  We're thrilled to have you!

== Getting started ==

You should probably start by reading the [http://groups.google.com/group/sockhoppers/web/ghop-faqs?hl=en GHOP FAQ].  If you meet the various requirements (you're 13 or over, in school, and have parental consent) and are still interested in participating in the contest, then you might want to check out Python before continuing.  There's a great [http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide Beginner's Guide]
that's the best place to start.

== Choosing tasks ==

There are a bunch of different tasks, ranging from documenting stuff, to giving a presentation on something, and even to programming.  You can visit the [http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-psf/issues/list issues tracker] to see all of the tasks that are still available, or you can go visit our TaskBreakdown page to see tasks grouped by category.

== Working on tasks ==

In the interests of fairness to you, the project, the mentors, and other students, we
have a few rules about working on the task.  The most important rule is that you need to *communicate* with us, the mentors, so that we know what's going on with your task and we  know that you're working on it.

So, if you are interested in working on a particular task, be sure you understand that:

 - you must complete the task within three days, unless you gain explicit permission from a project mentor (on the discussion mailing list) for an extension;

 - you can only claim one task at a time;

 - you must *communicate* with the discussion mailing list within a day of claiming the task, assuring us that you're still alive and that you're making progress.

 - a task is not *complete* until you've actually sent us something.  (Exactly what you need to send is specified in each task.)

If you don't complete the task on time, or try to claim multiple tasks, or don't communicate with us, we *will* re-open the task for other students to claim and you won't get credit for it!

== Completing tasks ==

Each task has a specific completion condition -- submitting patches to the documentation or to code, or uploading presentation materials, or whatnot.  Please attach the patches or presentation materials to the task by going to the issue page, click on "Add a comment...", and attaching the file or files.  Then (and this is very important!) *e-mail the discussion list* and ask for a mentor to look over the files you've uploaded.  Only a mentor can close a task!

== Disputes, arbitration, and general unfairness ==
If you have any questions or comments about your dealings with a particular mentor or set of mentors, please simply discuss them on the mailing list.  Note that there are general rules of conduct expected of you, as well as everyone else on the mailing list; see [http://www.albion.com/netiquette/ Netiquette] for more information.
