_Note: I tend to be fairly informal about these things.  Someone else could maybe write up some guidelines if they think it's too chaotic! --titus_

The primary requirement for a new task is that it be *specific*.

It helps if it's *relatively small*, but there's nothing wrong with challenging students with bigger tasks ;).  The idea is to have tasks take students *at most* 2-4 days with 2-3 hrs
of work a day, but obviously that will vary with student skills.

Don't feel like you need to write down every detail.  Students with good google fu (hah!) should be given enough info to figure stuff out, but we should be encouraging student communication.

Ultimately your task must be approved by someone.  For the moment the process is relatively informal: simply type up the description and send it to [http://groups.google.com/group/ghop-python-mentors the mentors list], where we will try to come to a consensus decision about whether the task is suitable for students.
  
Note that tasks cannot *build on other tasks*.

If you don't already have a project in mind but want to contribute by writing up a new project, go check out ProjectIdeaIndex.

= Submitting a task =

Just add an issue with a status of New.

Once the task is made available to students, it will be changed to Open.

Tasks that we withdraw or do not make available will be Deleted.
