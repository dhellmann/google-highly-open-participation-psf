= Task outline =

The primary requirement for a new task is that it be *specific*.

It helps if it's *relatively small*, but there's nothing wrong with challenging students with bigger tasks ;).  The idea is to have tasks take students *at most* 2-4 days with 2-3 hrs
of work a day, but obviously that will vary with student skills.

Don't feel like you need to write down every detail needed to accomplish the task, but do not be vague.  Students with good google fu (hah!) should be given enough info to figure stuff out, but we should be encouraging student communication.

Provide specific completion criteria for the task, so the completeness of a submission can be judged accurately.  Code and documentation contributions can be sent to individual project sites, but should also be added to the task as comments or file attachments.

Ultimately your task must be approved by someone.  For the moment the process is relatively informal: simply type up the description and send it to [http://groups.google.com/group/ghop-python ghop-python]; you can also send it to [mailto:titus@idyll.org Titus Brown] or one of the other admins.

Note that tasks cannot *build on other tasks that aren't complete yet*.  We have to wait to create dependent tasks until the dependencies are resolved.

If you don't already have a project in mind but want to contribute by writing up a new project, go check out ProjectIdeaIndex and ProjectSuggestionNotes!

= Submitting a task =

We're gathering tasks in the subversion repository for this project; look at 'em there.  You don't really need to do that, though; just send them to the list and we'll write them up in the appropriate format.

Note that Wiki markup (and live links) don't show up in task descriptions.  (This is a known "feature".)

Tasks that we withdraw or do not make available will be marked as Deleted.
