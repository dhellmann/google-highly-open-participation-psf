#summary Guidelines for coming up with new tasks.

= Task outline =

_Note: I tend to be fairly informal about these things.  Someone else could maybe write up some guidelines if they think it's too chaotic! --titus_

The primary requirement for a new task is that it be *specific*.

It helps if it's *relatively small*, but there's nothing wrong with challenging students with bigger tasks ;).

Ultimately your task must be approved by someone.  For the moment the process is relatively informal: simply type up the description and send it to [http://groups.google.com/group/ghop-python-mentors the mentors list], where we will try to come to a consensus decision about whether the task is suitable for students.
  
Note that tasks cannot *build on other tasks*.

If you don't already have a project in mind but want to contribute by writing up a new project, go check out ProjectIdeaIndex.

= Submitting a task =

Just add an issue with a status of New.

Once the task is made available to students, it will be changed to Open.

Tasks that we withdraw or do not make available will be Deleted.
