= Add useful terms to the glossary =

Author: Georg Brandl

In the new docs the glossary, previously in the tutorial, is meant to be a central location to explain Python- and probably computer science-specific terms that many newbie won't know yet.  The task is to collect more such terms, explain them in the glossary and cross-reference their occurrences in the rest of the docs.
