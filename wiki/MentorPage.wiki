We can use community help in a number of ways.

First, you can always lurk on the [http://groups.google.com/group/ghop-python general mailing list] and help students with problems.

Second, you can join the [http://groups.google.com/group/ghop-python-mentors mentors list] and submit new tasks and decide whether or not existing task goals have been met.

Whether or not you're on either of the lists, you're welcome to submit new task ideas.  Go check out our [NewTaskGuidelines new task guidelines].
