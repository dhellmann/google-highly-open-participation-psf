Author: Grig Gheorghiu

By now I think everybody is familiar with Tim Bray's Wide Finder
challenge: <http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/09/20/Wide-Finder>.
For those who are not familiar, Tim Bray is running a language/implementation
shoot-out for the fastest program that can parse a 1 million line log file.

The effbot has a few solutions in Python here: <http://effbot.org/zone/wide-finder.htm> -- one of them is a single-threaded program, the other one is a multi-threaded program,
and the third one is a simulation of a multi-processor program.

I think we can isolate 3 different tasks for the students, with each task taking
2 of effbot's 3 solutions, timing them over the course of a few runs, then
graphing them for comparison purposes using the matplotlib Python library.

For extra credit, the student would time and graph all 3 solutions.
