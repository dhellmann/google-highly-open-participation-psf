= Performance testing for WideFinder implementations =

Author: Grig Gheorghiu

By now I think everybody is familiar with Tim Bray's Wide Finder
challenge: <http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/09/20/Wide-Finder>.

I particularly liked the effbot's approach here:
<http://effbot.org/zone/wide-finder.htm>

For this tasklet, the students would run the 3 main implementations
(single threaded, multi threaded, multi-processor) on at least 2
machines, and generate performance graphs -- using matplotlib for
example. If MP machines are not available, then they'd do single- and
multi-threaded comparisons at least.

For extra credit, they could try improving the speed of the code.
