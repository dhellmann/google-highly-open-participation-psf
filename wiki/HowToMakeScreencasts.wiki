Screencasts are videos recorded on your computer showing the computer screen, usually with voice-over narration describing the activities being recorded.

Visit the !ShowMeDo site, and in particular the wiki at [http://wiki.showmedo.com/index.php/Main_Page] for more information about software, hardware, and tips for creating screencasts.

Wink ([http://www.debugmode.com/wink/]) is another option if you do not want to record a voice-over for the video.  See [http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-psf/issues/attachment?aid=-688663060195373061&name=ScreencastComplete.zip Rajiv Battula's submission for issue 247] for an example.
