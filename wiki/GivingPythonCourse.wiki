= Giving a Python course =

Author: Georg Brandl

I can also imagine a student learning enough basic Python to give his/her
class a small "course" (perhaps over two or three days), documenting this
effort via photos and perhaps a report from the relevant teacher. This
will spread knowledge of Python (most interested students will still start
out with PHP because most web hosters offer it exclusively and "everyone
does it", at least here...)
