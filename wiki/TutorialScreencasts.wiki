#summary Project idea: have students prepare short tutorials like those at ShowMeDo.com.

= Pros =

  * The [http://www.youtube.com YouTube] generation thinks user-generated video is cool.
  * People at all skills levels could take part (i.e., lower cost of entry than hacking the core library).
  * This project would attract people with skills in areas other than pure hacking (i.e., we wouldn't be preaching to the converted).
  * Students would be able to understand/appreciate/review other students' work.
  * People could contribute by doing an ABC-language version of someone else's XYZ-language contribution.
  * A "best of" show would make a great [http://www.pycon.org/ PyCon] event.

= Cons =

  * Doesn't add new capabilities to Python, the standard library, or related tools.
