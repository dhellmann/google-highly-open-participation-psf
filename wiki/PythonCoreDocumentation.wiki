Author: Georg Brandl

Also, I could think of some short-term documentation tasks, such as
 * adding code examples to a few library docs
 * syncing up docstrings and written documentation (make sure the docstring contain all essential information from the docs, and the docs contain everything the docstring does)
 * documenting the command-line interface
 * documenting a missing set of C API functions (PySys comes to mind)
 * bringing the reference count data up to date (perhaps too much for 3 days, having to learn reference counting details)
