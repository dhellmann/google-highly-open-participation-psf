Many such modules already exist, so this would mean either enhancing
them, or writing alternative implementations from scratch.

Examples:

python-twitter: http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/

python-facebook: http://groups.google.com/group/pyfacebook

python-digg:

python-myspace: doesn't exist yet, but see
http://www.kiberpipa.org/~gandalf/blog/?p=73

interesting especially to a highschooler.
