#summary Members of the Python community who have contributed tasks.

= Contributors =

Leslie Hawthorn @ Google (now an honorary member of the Python community ;) organized everything to a T, aided by the sockhoppers mailing list (don't ask about the name...)

The ghop-python gaggle wrote and proofed the tasks and the Wiki pages: Georg Brandl, Titus Brown, Will Guaraldi, Doug Hellmann, and Andr√© Roberge.

The py-skunkworks gang came up with the basic list of task ideas: Brett Cannon, Collin Winter, Michal Kwiatkowski, Duncan !McGreggor, Georg Brandl, David Goodger, Grig Gheorghiu, Greg Wilson, James Tauber, and Titus Brown.

Several people answered our sporadic cries for help and new ideas, including 
Terry Peppers, Shannon Behrens, Michael Carter, Phil Hassey, and Michael Mol.

The wonderful commenters over at Titus Brown's blog (see [http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/nov-07/new-to-python-projects.html Projects for People New to Python] and [http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/nov-07/hidden-gems-in-stdlib.html Hidden Gems in stdlib]) suggested a number of projects and modules in need of love.
