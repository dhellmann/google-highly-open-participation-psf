#summary Tasks Requiring Completion by Administrators

= Introduction =

This is just a place to put those things that you know you'll forget if they don't
go *somewhere*. Please remove a task when you've done it.


= Outstanding Tasks =

Create DocumentationAndExampleGuidelines page (we have WorkingOnDocumentation and WritingExampleCode though).

Go through tasks and make sure that necessary Wiki pages are linked to

See [http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-psf/w/list?q=label:needs-work the list of pages that need work]

 - BenchmarkingAndProfiling needs to be written
 - DocumentationAndExampleGuidelines is empty, but may be redundant because the information it would seem to want to contain is present in other pages
 - GettingAndCompilingPython needs instructions for Windows.
 - HowToTest has a list of topics to be included, but no real text
 - Python3K is empty, but is it needed?  We have instructions for checking out the 3.0 source tree, where necessary.  Are there other differences?
 - RecordingTestCoverage needs to be written
 - SearchingTheDocumentation is empty, but the description sounds vague.  We have tasks with instructions for updating specific sections of the docs.  Do we still need this page?
 - TaskBreakdown needs to be checked against the current task list to ensure all are included

Write TaskBreakdown page

Go through blog comments and e-mail and add tasks or update ProjectIdeaIndex.

Discuss licenses somewhere!
