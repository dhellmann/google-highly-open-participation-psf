#summary Things that need to be done

*Change tasks from open to new*

Go through tasks and make sure that necessary Wiki pages are written and linked to from the comments.  Wiki info I know we'll need: python co and compile; python doc contributing; adding example code; benchmarking; searching the docs; python30; screencast howto; running python unit tests; measuring test coverage; testing in general.

Go through blog comments and e-mail and add tasks or update ProjectIdeas.

Document what a completed task is; reviews by mentor ok, mentors will be guided by
primary developers if available!

Talk about "extra credit" & "best student" award

Note: add to Deleted tasks, "this task was entered incorrectly and work on
it is not eligible for the Google Highly Open Participation Contest"

Discuss licenses somewhere!
