PySoy: Add "dot3" .normal property to soy.materials.Material
"""

description = """
Add a .normal property to soy.materials.Material which, when given a
Texture instance and the appropriate OpenGL extensions available
(tested by GLEW), renders a tangent space normals texture.

Some OpenGL/GLEW functions and enums may need to be added to gl.pxd.
Must render on i915, Xorg's free radeon/r200, and proprietary nVidia
drivers.  Help is available on checking for extension support and
testing on different video cards and drivers.

The source can be obtained through svn co
http://svn.pysoy.org/trunk/pysoy Some inter-module API changes are
permissible to implement this.

Completion:
