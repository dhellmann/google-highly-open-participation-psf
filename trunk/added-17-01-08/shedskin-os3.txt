summary = """
Add support for seven 'os' modules in Shed Skin
"""

description = """
Download and install Shed Skin, and read the included README for 
usage instructions:

    http://shedskin.googlecode.com

Especially read the part about how to implement libraries. Have 
a look at the lib/ directory for examples of several standard 
library module implementations.

Add support for the following functions in the 'os' module. You'll 
need to have experience with C and C++ to pull this off!

getpid
putenv
umask
unsetenv
chmod
renames

See task #240 and #297, which are similar to this task and both
completed.

Completion:

Submit a patch for each function as an attachment to this ticket,
making sure it works correctly under Windows and Linux.
