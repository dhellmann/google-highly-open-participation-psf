Extend Game Baker demo game to a fully playable game
"""

description = """
Game Baker is a graphical game development system.

   http://code.google.com/p/game-baker/

We would like you to extend our pong demo to a fully playable game.
Currently the game is rather easy to play to say the least.

The demo is in our SVN under demos/test2-pong.py (or you can download
the svn snapshot from the project homepage).

Once you have run this script a file "testgame.gb" will be created,
which you can open from the main gui ("gamebaker.py"). for this
project you may either modify the .gb file from the GUI or the file
test2-pong.py, which creates the demo from python.

You may find our python scripting reference useful:

   http://code.google.com/p/game-baker/wiki/PythonScripting

n.b. - each game object has a "workstate", which contains all of the
object's event handlers.

Completion:
 - deflect the ball depending on the speed of the paddle.
 - make the computer's paddle try to follow the position of the ball
   (not too well or the player can't win!).
 - enter any bugs or feature ideas in our issue tracking system.
 - submit your .gb or .py file attached to this issue
 - write up a tutorial on how your event code works.
 - give game-baker permission to release your code under both the GPL and LGPL

(This task sounds like a lot, but the entire game is currently about
40 lines of scripted python event handlers, so it shouldn't be too hard.)
