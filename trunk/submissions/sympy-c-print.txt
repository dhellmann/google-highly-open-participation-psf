SymPy - implement c code printing
"""

description = """

SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics:

http://code.google.com/p/sympy/

download it, play with it.

Write a function, that will accept a SymPy expression and it will return a
string, that can be compiled using a C compiler (no references to Python from
C).

Example:

print_c(sin(x)**4 * y**2)

would print

float x;
float y;
e = pow(sin(x), 4)*pow(y,2);

Of course, only a subset of SymPy's expressions (only those that have a
corresponding C/math function) could be converted this way.

More information here:

http://code.google.com/p/sympy/issues/detail?id=475

Please join the SymPy mailinglist (see the webpage) and ask any questions you
might have about SymPy in there.
