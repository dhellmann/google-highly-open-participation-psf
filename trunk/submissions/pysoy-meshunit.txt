soy.meshes.Mesh unit test
"""

description = """
Create a unit test (in tests/) which verifies the order, reusability, and 
overall sanity of Vertex and Face objects added to a soy.meshes.Mesh.  
Examples on how Vertex, Face, and Mesh objects work together can be seen at 
http://svn.pysoy.org/trunk/pysoy/examples/blocks.py.

This means that the mesh .faces[n] should remain at that position regardless 
of new faces being added and other manipulations being made, .verts[n] should 
likewise remain predictable both for the mesh and each face.

If a face is added which shares 1 or 2 already known verticies, it should 
reference the two already known which should remain in their current list 
positions (.verts[n]).

The source can be obtained through svn co http://svn.pysoy.org/trunk/pysoy
