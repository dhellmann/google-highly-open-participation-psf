Create a conversion tool that converts python docstrings to google wiki markup.
"""

description = """
This task is inspired by an unexpected solution to a previous GHOP task. When asked to generate a wiki documentation page for a module the student wrote a simple script that extracted the docstrings and automatically generated a simple wiki markup:

see http://python-statlib.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/misc/

For this task you will need to create a more robust script that takes as  input a python module, (or package directory) and generates a wiki page (with Goole wiki markup) for the module (or each module in the package). 

Use the Epytext markup language for the syntax that your script should be able to parse (see http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/manual-epytext.html). You may consider writing your own parser or use an existing parsing library such as pyparsing (see http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/).

To complete the task your script needs to be able to format the:
 - headings 
 - paragraph
 - B{} (bold)
 - I{} italic 
 - doctest strings

Extra credit: implement any other epydoc markup.

Relevant webpages:

For the Google wiki syntax see: http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax

PS: this script has the potential to be very widely used as more and more python projects are hosted via Google Code. Thus a good job on this task has the potential of providing you with long term satisfaction (and bragging rights).
