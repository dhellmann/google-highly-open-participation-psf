Create a conversion tool that converts python docstrings to google wiki markup.
"""

description = """
This task is inspired by an unexpected solution to a previous GHOP task. 
When asked to generate a wiki documentation page for a module the student 
wrote a simple script that extracted the docstrings and automatically 
generated a simple wiki markup:

see http://python-statlib.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/misc/

For this task you will need to create a more robust script that takes as 
input a python module, (or package directory) and generates a wiki page 
(with Goole wiki markup) for the module (or each module in the package). 
Use the Epydoc markup language for the syntax that your script 
should be able to parse.

To complete the task you script needs to be able to handle the:
 - headings 
 - B{} (bold)
 - I{} italic 
 - doctest strings

Extra credit: implement any other epydoc markup.

Relevant webpages:

Epydoc markup:http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/manual-epytext.html
For the Google wiki syntax see: http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax
The recommended parsing library is pyparsing: http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/

PS: this script has the potential to be very widely used as more and more python
projects are hosted via Google Code. Thus a good job on this task has the 
potential of providing you with long term satisfaction (and bragging rights).
