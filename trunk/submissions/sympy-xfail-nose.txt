SymPy - implement XFAIL in the nose testing framework
"""

description = """

SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics:

http://code.google.com/p/sympy/

download it, play with it.

XFAIL: get it work in in nose:

http://code.google.com/p/sympy/issues/detail?id=389

How it works is explained in the issue above. Currently,
the XFAIL only works in serial mode in py.test (we use it
regularly in sympy). Implement a patch to the nose
testing framework:

http://somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose/

implementing this feature.

Please join the SymPy mailinglist (see the webpage) and ask any
questions you might have about SymPy in there.
