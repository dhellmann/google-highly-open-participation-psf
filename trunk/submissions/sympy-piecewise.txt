SymPy - implement piecewise functions support
"""

description = """
SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics:

http://code.google.com/p/sympy/

download it, play with it.

Create support for piecewise functions in SymPy:

http://code.google.com/p/sympy/issues/detail?id=353

do it by creating a new SymPy function Piecewise, that will be called
like this:

p = Piecewise(x, [[(-oo,0), 0], [(0,1), x], [(1,oo), 1]])

and it will hold all the information and behave like a normal
function, thus

p.diff(x)

will produce another (correct) Piecewise function.

Read:

http://code.google.com/p/sympy/wiki/SymPySvn

for how to create your own functions.

Please join the SymPy mailinglist (see the webpage) and ask any
questions you might have about SymPy in there.
