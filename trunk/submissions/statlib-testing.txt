Converting statlib tests to docstrings
"""

description = """
The goal of the statlib project is to combine several python statistics modules 
into a single package.

See http://python-statlib.googlecode.com

A previous GHOP task has combined a number of statistics libraries into 
this package. This task now builds upon that result and aims to improve 
the package in several ways. The following sub-tasks need to be completed:

1. Modify the Dispatch class in the stats.py module to operate on NumPy instances. 
The current behavior expects Numeric arrays but the Numeric library has been super seeded 
by NumPy (you will need to install NumPy on your computer, see http://numpy.scipy.org/ )

2. Rewrite the test/test_allstats.py script to use doctests (see the HowToTest page on 
the Python GHOP wiki) and create a single text file that contains only docstrings. Modify 
the test data to use regular python lists rather than numerical arrays so that the 
tests can be run on systems without numerical libraries installed.

Suggestion: step 2 can be done by hand one test at a time, but you could write 
a script to generate the docstrings by combining the existing program and its output

Use the most current source code archive for your work. To complete the task create 
a new archive (with python setup.py sdist ) that contains your modifications and attach 
it to this issue.
