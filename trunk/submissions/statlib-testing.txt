summary = """
Increase the unit test coverage of the statlib package
"""

description = """
The goal of the statlib project is to combine several python statistics modules 
into a single package.

See http://python-statlib.googlecode.com

A previous GHOP task has combined a number of statistics modules into 
this package. This task now builds upon that result and aims to improve 
the test coverage of this package 

Raise the coverage of the test/test_all.py script to over 70% from the current 20%.
Use the test/cover.py script to measure your coverage. See the test/data/test_allstats.py 
script for test cases (the first few tests have been transferred already) and rewrite them 
in a manner that follows the conventions of the test_all.py script.

Relevant wiki pages:

 - HowToTest
 - RecordingTestCoverage

Download the most current statlib source code distribution. To complete the task attach 
the new version of the test_all.py script to this issue.
