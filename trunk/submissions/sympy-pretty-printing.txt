Unicode pretty-printing: font issues

http://code.google.com/p/sympy/issues/detail?id=447

We've implemented ascii-art 2D pretty-printing of formulas, and it works
reliable in unicode capable terminal such as UXTerm:

But in other terminals, and firefox browser the rendering is not so
nice - lines that have to be countinuous, are not.

We've tracked down that this issue is related to fonts, and we'd like a
student to find a way to properly tune common applications
(gnome-terminal, firefox) to display the drawing nicely.


Please join the SymPy mailinglist (see the webpage) and ask any
questions you might have about SymPy in there.
