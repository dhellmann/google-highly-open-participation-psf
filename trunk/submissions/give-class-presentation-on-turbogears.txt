presentation and uploading your slides in PDF format.

Attach files containing the slides and give us information on when/where
you will be presenting, you don't need to actually hold this presentation 
before this task is considered completed, but we expect that you do it 
eventually (we'd also love to see a photo and hear about your
experience; consider that part of the bonus points.)
