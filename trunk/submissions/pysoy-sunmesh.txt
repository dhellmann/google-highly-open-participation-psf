PySoy: Create soy.meshes.Sun
"""

description = """
Create a soy.meshes.Sun class with the following suggested properties:

 * .spot - the central (direct) spot of the sun
 * .aura - the large fuzzy glow around the sun
 * .streaks - cross-shaped streaks emanating from the star

These can be rendered as in a soy.meshes.Billboard using triangle fans
for the spot and aura, and four triangles for the streaks.  Student is
encouraged to be creative in implementation and may add or change
these properties or add additional properties which enable different
artistic rendering styles.

For example, a 1d texture could be supported to color the halo and
streaks, defaulting to a basic "white to alpha" 2-texel 1d builtin
texture.

The latter two (aura and streaks) should diminish in intensity when
the spot is covered when one of the following is available (tested via
GLEW): * GL_ARB_occlusion_query * GL_NV_occlusion_query *
GL_HP_occlusion_test

Some OpenGL/GLEW functions and enums may need to be added to gl.pxd.
Must render on i915, Xorg's free radeon/r200, and proprietary nVidia
drivers.  Help is available on checking for extension support and
testing on different video cards and drivers.

The source can be obtained through svn co http://svn.pysoy.org/trunk/pysoy
