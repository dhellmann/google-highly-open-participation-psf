PySoy: Create soy.meshes.Liquid
"""

description = """
Create a new soy.meshes class which renders the surface of a liquid (ie, 
water) and it's depth through volumetric fog using GL_EXT_fog_coord, 
demonstrated with a small example script.

At minimum color and size properties should be available.  A provided material 
should render as the surface with it's alpha blending properly.

Extensions should be tested using GLEW.  Some OpenGL/GLEW functions and enums 
may need to be added to gl.pxd.  Must render on i915, Xorg's free radeon/r200, 
and proprietary nVidia drivers (ie, no GLSL).  Help is available on checking 
for extension support and testing on different video cards and drivers.

The source can be obtained through svn co http://svn.pysoy.org/trunk/pysoy
Some inter-module API changes are permissible to implement this.


Completion:
