Add soy.meshes.Billboard class which renders a material on a quad
"""

description = """
A "billboard" is a quad (rectangle) which is always rendered facing the 
camera, sometimes called a "sprite".  There are numerous tutorials for doing 
this using OpenGL.  soy.meshes.Billboard must render such a quad with optional 
axis-alignment set via boolean property.  

A soy.meshes.Mesh class handles rendering by the orientation and position of 
the soy.bodies.* it belongs to, each mesh can potentially belong to many 
bodies.

As can be seen in the code ( 
http://svn.pysoy.org/trunk/pysoy/src/meshes/Mesh.pxi) the only OpenGL code 
needed to implement this is that specific to billboards; soy.bodies.Body has 
already transformed into the scene and the Billboard's .material property will 
handle color/texture/etc. 

The source can be obtained through svn co http://svn.pysoy.org/trunk/pysoy
