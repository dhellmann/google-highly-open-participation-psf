Record a screencast for PyQt.
"""

description = """
Install PyQt4. If you have Windows, you can download the binary
installer (http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt/download.php),
otherwise you'll have to compile it and its dependencies from the
source. For that you'll need SIP (http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/
sip/download.php), the Qt library (http://trolltech.com/downloads/
opensource#qt-open-source-edition), and the PyQt4 sources
(http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt/download.php).

Then, record a screencast of the demo app (located in examples/tools).
Be sure to go through at least 10 different examples, showing how the
examples work.

Completion:

Attach either a file containing the screencast, or the URL of the
screencast, to this task.  The screencast must be in an acceptable
format and should be under 100 mb in size; see HowToMakeScreencasts.
Be sure to post it with an acceptable license; see StudentPage for
more information.
