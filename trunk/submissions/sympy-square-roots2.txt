SymPy - implement square roots denesting
"""

description = """

SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics:

http://code.google.com/p/sympy/

download it, play with it.

Square roots: implement denesting:

http://code.google.com/p/sympy/issues/detail?id=93

Implement the algorithm as described in the paper (see the link above).
Simple tests like sqrt(5+2*sqrt(6) and sqrt(3+2*sqrt(3)) should
be denested.


Please join the SymPy mailinglist (see the webpage) and ask any
questions you might have about SymPy in there.
