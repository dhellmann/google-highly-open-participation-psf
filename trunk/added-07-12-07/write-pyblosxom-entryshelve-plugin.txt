Write a new entry cache plugin using shelve for PyBlosxom 2.0
"""

description = """
PyBlosxom 1.4.x and previous versions had entry caching infrastructure.  
This code has been removed for PyBlosxom 2.0 and replaced with a couple of 
callbacks.

The entryshelve functionality needs to be written as a PyBlosxom plugin using 
the new PyBlosxom 2.0 callbacks.

The code for PyBlosxom 2.0 is in the trunk--it hasn't been released yet.

It's very likely you can reuse the code from PyBlosxom 1.4.x--check the 
PYBLOSXOM_1_4 branch for code.  Also, the Entry level caching specification 
documents the new interface for entry-level caching.

The documentation on writing plugins will be helpful:

http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/1.4/manual/dev_writing_plugins.html

Write a new entryshelve plugin that works with the code in trunk in 
PyBlosxom's SVN repository with documentation and tests.


Completion:

Upload the file containing your entry cache shelve plugin as an 
attachment to this task.
