Write a trac wiki macro plugin to embed a "progress meter" in a wiki page.
"""

description = """
Create a trac (http://trac.edgewall.org) wiki macro plugin to display
a "progress" meter similar to the one visible in the Roadmap view
(http://trac.edgewall.org/roadmap).  The tickets included in the meter
should be selected using the same syntax as the TicketQuery macro.

The macro user should be able to use the TicketQuery and new macro
together on a wiki page to, for example, build a report of the
progress on tickets with a certain keyword (say, a customer name or
feature code-name) or all tickets owned by a particular person within
a milestone.

By default, the progress should be based on the number of tickets
completed.  For extra credit, support using a user-specified numeric
field (integer or float) of the ticket as a "point" value instead of
just counting the tickets.  For example to display the estimated
number of hours completed for a set of tasks owned by dhellmann, the
user would write something like:

  [[ProgressMeter(owner=dhellmann, ticket_value=hours)]]

Feel free to select your own name for the plugin and the
"ticket_value" argument.

Completion:

Attach an archive file (zip, tar.gz, egg, etc.) with the source code  
for the plugin as a comment on this task.  Make sure to include  
installation and usage instructions.
