Update trac to include more ticket fields in outgoing email headers
"""

description = """
Update trac (http://trac.edgewall.org) so that all fields of a ticket,
including user-defined fields, are included as headers of outgoing
email generated when the ticket is modified.

For example, include the Reporter field value in the X-trac-reporter
header and the Component field value in the X-trac-component header.
Be aware that some values may span multiple lines, and need to be
formatted appropriately to create valid email headers.

It is not clear whether a plugin can implement this change, or if it
needs to be handled through a patch.  If the work can be done with a
plugin, that is preferred.

Completion, plugin:

Attach an archive file (zip, tar.gz, egg, etc.) with the source code
for the plugin as a comment on this task.  Make sure to include
installation and usage instructions.

For extra credit, submit the plugin to Trac Hacks
(http://trac-hacks.org) and link to the results here.

Completion, patch:

If it is not possible to implement this change as a plugin, use a
patch file as generated by "svn diff".  Explain why the patch is
required (instead of the plugin) using a comment on this ticket.

For extra credit, submit the patch to the trac team via their ticket
system, and link to the ticket here.
