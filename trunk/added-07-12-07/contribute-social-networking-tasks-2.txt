summary = """
Write 5 or more new tasks around social networking site functionality.
"""

description = """

Write at least 5 detailed task suggestions around combining existing
social networking sites with Python.  This can involve

 - creating new applications (in Python) to be hosted through the
   social networking site (e.g. Facebook applications),

 - writing meta-applications (in Python) to manipulate and extract
   information from the sites using existing Python libraries,

 - adding specific (and somewhat ambitious) functionality to existing
   Python libraries,

 - creating new Python libraries.

We strongly suggest discussing your ideas on the ghop-python list before
committing to writing them up in detail; it's your responsibility to make
sure that the tasks are reasonable!

Also note that you will be ineligible to work on the tasks that you write,
for legal reasons.

Completion:

Send your final task suggestions to the ghop-python mailing list and
allow discussion for 24 hrs.  Revise according to suggestions and
attach to this task, along with a pointer to the ghop-python thread.
