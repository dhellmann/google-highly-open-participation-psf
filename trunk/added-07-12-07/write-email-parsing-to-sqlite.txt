description = """
Write code that reads in e-mail files, parses the headers into a sqlite
database, and then uses the sqlite full-text search system to search
for specific headers or text.  Implement a simple search language in
cmd that lets you retrieve specific messages based on search parameters.

For extra kudos, support flattening and searching of HTML e-mails.

Attach the final code, with tests (doctests?) and/or examples.
