summary = """
Discuss (and implement?) a solution to the "single instance" rosettacode task.
"""

description = """

RosettaCode.org is a wiki containing implementations of common
algorithms in multiple languages.  Many of the pages include Python
sample code, but some do not.  To complete this task, submit a
discussion of how this could be implemented for at least one platform
(Windows, Linux, Mac OS X); for extra kudos, implement it.

http://rosettacode.org/rosettacode/w/index.php?title=Determine_if_Only_One_Instance_is_Running

Completion:

Send your discussion to the ghop-python list and (assuming it's specific
enough) post it to the rosettacode.org wiki.

Other information:

Please read the instructions for contributing content to
RosettaCode.org
(http://rosettacode.org/rosettacode/w/index.php?title=Help:Contribute_Content
and
http://rosettacode.org/rosettacode/w/index.php?title=Help:Adding_a_new_programming_example)
before posting anything to the site.

Feel free to ask for help via email on the ghop-python list or
comments on this task.  The existing sample code for other languages
may not be the best possible solution for Python, but should give you
an idea of how to implement the algorithms.  All of the programming
tasks listed above can be implemented using native language operations
or standard library modules.
