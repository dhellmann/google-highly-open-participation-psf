Find five interesting Panda3d particle effects.
"""

description = """
Panda3D is a 3D engine: a library of subroutines for 3D rendering and
game development. The library is C++ with a set of Python
bindings. Game development with Panda3D usually consists of writing a
Python program that controls the Panda3D library.

See http://code.google.com/p/python-panda3d-examples/.

Panda3D comes with highly customizable particle effects but there is
little to no information on what these effects look like or what parameters
one might choose to simulate various desired outcomes: explosion,
fire, splash, smoke, wapor, "cool magic effect" etc.

For this task you'll need to investigate and create five (or more)
interesting effects.

Your program should load the parameters for each effect from an
external file (.ini or json format) and display them in multiple ways:
when the particle source is static, particle source moving on a linear
and circular paths. Wiki page needs to show screenshots of the
effects.

Recommendations: Panda3D manual page on particle effects, look at the
particle panel distributed as a Panda3D sample program (though it is
slightly quirky on my machine).

For extra kudos, make a screencast of your various effects.

Completion:

Attach your source code with all necessary supporting files to this task.
Add a wiki page to the python-panda3d-examples wiki explaining your program.
