description = """

Add documentation and examples to the 'inspect' module in the Python
2.6 standard library.

See DocumentationAndExampleGuidelines for general information on
getting the latest docs, editing them, and generating patches.

Details for this specific module:

 - Integrate as much as is practical of Doug Hellmann's PyMOTW
   post on inspect into the official docs, focusing on specific
   examples.

Add these examples in a separate 'examples' section.

Completion:

Attach the results of a 'svn diff' (context diff) against the Python
source tree to this task in a comment, and send an e-mail briefly
describing the changes you made to the ghop-python mailing list.
