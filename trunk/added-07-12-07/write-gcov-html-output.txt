Write a gcov reader and a gcov-to-HTML converter.
"""

description = """
'gcov' is a coverage analysis program for the GNU C compiler,

   http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html

Using a C program of your choice, get some gcov output, and write a parser
to read the gcov output into a Python class structure.  (This can be a
simple structure, but please avoid using just a list or a dictionary; make
it easy to understand.)

Then write a simple gcov-to-HTML converter.

For extra kudos, support the '-b' (branch) output.

Completion:

Attach the source code and some sample output to this task.
