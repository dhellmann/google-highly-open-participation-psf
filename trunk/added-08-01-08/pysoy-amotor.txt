summary = """
Add working motor properties to angular joints and Drive action to power it
"""

description = """
Add motor properties to the appropriate soy.joints (Ball, Universal, etc) 
which creates the AMotor for that joint when one or more angular axis are 
defined.  Then create soy.actions.Drive which powers the specified axis, and 
lastly create a short demo for how to use it in examples/

Ensure that axis can be removed and the AMotor associated with the joint is 
removed along with the last axis and during joint destruction.  Also ensure 
that any Drive action specified to use an axis which is removed does nothing 
rather than segfaulting or locking up the simulation.

There should be sufficient example code between soy.joints, soy.actions, and 
the ODE joints documentation to complete this task.  Code must be done in 
Pyrex using the existing coding conventions.

The source can be obtained through svn co http://svn.pysoy.org/trunk/pysoy
