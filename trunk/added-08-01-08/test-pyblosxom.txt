Increase test coverage for PyBlosxom
"""

description = """
Progress on PyBlosxom 2.0 is moving along.  One of the things that is 
seriously hampering efforts is that very little of the codebase is 
covered by unit tests.

The PyBlosxom 2.0 code is in the trunk.  Details on where to find
the code are on the web-site at 
http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/blog/static/development .

PyBlosxom uses nose to do unit test discovery.  Details on how
to run the tests are at the bottom of the README file in the codebase.

The task here is to increase the test coverage from 39% to at least 
60% for the code in PyBlosxom SVN trunk.

Things you could look at adding tests for to increase test coverage:
  - Pyblosxom.pyblosxom.EnvironmentDict
  - Pyblosxom.pyblosxom.Request
  - Pyblosxom.pyblosxom.Response
  - Pyblosxom.pyblosxom.blosxom_entry_parser
  - Pyblosxom.tools.run_callback (there's some work on this already)
  - Pyblosxom.renderers.blosxom.get_included_flavour
  - Pyblosxom.renderers.blosxom.get_flavour_from_dir
  - Pyblosxom.renderers.blosxom.BlosxomRenderer
  - and others....

Completion:
  - a svn diff against the trunk
  - the coverage report before and after
  - a written explanation of what tests were added, any problems 
    you encountered and any other observations that would help to 
    improve testing for PyBlosxom in the future

Any questions, please comment in this issue or find willguaraldi in
either #python-ghop or #pyblosxom on irc.freenode.net.
