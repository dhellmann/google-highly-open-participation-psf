SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics:

http://code.google.com/p/sympy/

download it, play with it.

The task is to improve the docstrings and wiki:

http://code.google.com/p/sympy/issues/detail?id=294

Go to:

http://sympy.googlecode.com/svn/api/sympy.html

and make sure there is no "Undocumented" line on the front page by writing
at least a few lines of documentation for each module.

Please join the SymPy mailinglist (see the webpage) and ask any questions you
might have about SymPy in there.
