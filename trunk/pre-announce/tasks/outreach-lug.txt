Write about attending a user group meeting.
"""

description = """

Attend a meeting of your local Python user group and post online about
what happened at the meeting, the presentations given, and what you
learned.  You can post the write-up to your own web site or blog, or
the user group's site, if it has one.

Submit a URL to the completed write-up by pasting it into a comment on
the task.  The URL must be available to be indexed by a search engine
and visible to any reader on the internet without requiring special
permissions (for example, access cannot be limited to "friends" in a
social network).  Most web sites and blogs meet this requirement.

Include a reference to GHOP, PSF, and the task number for this task in
the write-up.
