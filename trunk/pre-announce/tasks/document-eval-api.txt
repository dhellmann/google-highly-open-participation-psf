Document the PyEval_* C API functions in the C API Reference.
"""

description = """

There are several public C API functions (mostly in Python/ceval.c) which are
not documented in the API reference document at

  http://docs.python.org/dev/c-api

Collect them (their names all begin with "PyEval_"), find out what they
do (which is quite trivial in most cases) and add an appropriate paragraph
to the API documentation.

See the DocumentationAndExampleGuidelines and WorkingOnDocumentation wiki
pages for helpful information, under

   http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-psf/w/list
