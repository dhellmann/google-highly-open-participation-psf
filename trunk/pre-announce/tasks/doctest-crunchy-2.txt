summary = """
Add unit tests for Crunchy.
"""

description = """
Crunchy makes use of doctest to test some of its modules.  Add new
doctest-based tests to for the three functions in the module
vlam_editor.py.  Ask for help if you need a starting point.  You can
download Crunchy from

http://code.google.com/p/crunchy

Bonus points: Use the knowledge you've gained to write doctest-based
for other modules after you check in your completed task.

Completion:

Attach your new doctests to this task in either a set of files or
(better) as the results of an 'svn diff' against the latest crunchy
source.  Send a brief description of your changes to the ghop-python
list.
