Add example code to the wsgiref module documentation.
"""

description = """
Write examples for the wsgiref module docs.

See DocumentationAndExampleGuidelines for general information on
getting the latest docs, editing them, and generating patches.

Details for this specific module:

 - Add a documented and fully functional example of a "Hello, world"
   application to a new 'examples' section of the wsgiref module docs
   (i.e. implement 'demo_app' in the wsgiref.simple_server section).

 - Expand the discussion of wsgiref.util.setup_testing_defaults() by
   adding an example;

 - Add an example of FileWrapper use.

 - Write an example showing how to use validator, including a simple
   example of a broken WSGI application.  (Choose your breakage so
   validator breaks, obviously.)

Completion:

Attach the results of a 'svn diff' (context diff) against the Python
source tree to this task in a comment, and send an e-mail briefly
describing the changes you made to the ghop-python mailing list.
