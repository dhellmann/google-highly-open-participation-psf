Implement challenging rosettacode.org programming tasks with Python
"""

description = """

RosettaCode.org is a wiki containing implementations of common
algorithms in multiple languages.  Many of the pages include Python
sample code, but some do not.  To complete this task, submit
implementations for the algorithms listed below.

- http://rosettacode.org/rosettacode/w/index.php?title=Data_Representation_-_Controlling_Fields_in_a_Structure
- http://rosettacode.org/rosettacode/w/index.php?title=Object_Serialization
- http://rosettacode.org/rosettacode/w/index.php?title=XML_and_XPath

Completion:

Edit the RosettaCode.org wiki to add a Python example to each of the 
pages listed above.  Once all of your examples are posted, add a
comment here and send an email to the ghop-python mailing list.  All
of the code samples will be tested before this task is marked as
completed, so check your work!

Other information:

Please read the instructions for contributing content to
RosettaCode.org
(http://rosettacode.org/rosettacode/w/index.php?title=Help:Contribute_Content
and
http://rosettacode.org/rosettacode/w/index.php?title=Help:Adding_a_new_programming_example)
before posting anything to the site.

Feel free to ask for help via email on the ghop-python list or
comments on this task.  The existing sample code for other languages
may not be the best possible solution for Python, but should give you
an idea of how to implement the algorithms.  All of the programming
tasks listed above can be implemented using native language operations
or standard library modules.
