"""

description = """

Measure the number of lines executed by the unit tests included with
Python 2.6 for the 'DocXMLRPCServer' module, using figleaf or coverage
(see MeasuringCodeCoverage).  Add new tests that increase the code
coverage for this module to > 80%.  Submit a context diff (see
SubmittingPatches) and text or HTML files containing both the old and
new test coverage results.

Completion:

Attach the results of an 'svn diff' (context diff) against the Python
source tree to this task. Also include text containing the old and new
code coverage numbers and a brief description of the changes you've made.
