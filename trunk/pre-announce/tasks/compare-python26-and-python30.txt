Document syntax changes between Python 2.6 and Python 3.0
"""

description = """

Python 3.0 is not compatible with Python 2.6. Write a medium-length
(2-3 page) text or reStructuredText (preferred) document giving examples
of syntax that worked in Python 2.6 but do not work in Python 3.0.

See PEP 3100, http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3100/, "Core
Language", for inspiration.  A straightforward walkthrough of the
Python language changes (ignoring the C syntax changes) mentioned in
this section would be very acceptable.
