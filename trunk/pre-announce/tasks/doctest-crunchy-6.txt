summary = """
Add unit tests for Crunchy.
"""

description = """
Crunchy makes use of doctest to test some of its modules.  Add
new doctest-based tests to increase the number of functions/methods
that are currently unit tested.  Ask for help if you
need a starting point.  You can download Crunchy from

http://code.google.com/p/crunchy

If you claim this task, you should work on adding tests for only one Crunchy module and you must specify the name of the module you
are writing tests for.  For the purpose of the GHOP contest, you can not
do more than 3 tasks of this kind.
