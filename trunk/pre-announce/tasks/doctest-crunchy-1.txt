summary = """
Add unit tests for Crunchy.
"""

description = """
Crunchy makes use of doctest to test some of its modules.  Add
new doctest-based tests to increase the number of functions/methods
that are currently unit tested in the module utilities.py.  Ask for help if you need a starting point.  You can download Crunchy from

http://code.google.com/p/crunchy

Bonus points: Use the knowledge you've gained to write doctest-based for other modules after you check in your completed task.
