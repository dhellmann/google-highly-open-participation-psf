Test the 'bisect' and 'heapq' module Python code in Python 2.6.
"""

description = """
Measure the number of lines executed by the unit tests included with
Python 2.6 for the 'bisect' and 'heapq' modules, using figleaf or
coverage (see MeasuringCodeCoverage).  Add new tests that increase the
code coverage for this module to > 95%.  Submit a context diff (see
SubmittingPatches) and text or HTML files containing both the old and
new test coverage results.

Note that for both bisect and heapq, the C implementation is already
tested thouroughly; for example, see test/test_bisect.py in the Python
2.6 subversion archive.  A good approach would be to modify the bisect
and heapq modules so that you can import the Python code instead of
the C code, and make sure that all of the tests work properly.
