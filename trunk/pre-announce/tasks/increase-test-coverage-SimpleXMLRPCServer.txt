summary = """
Increase the unit test coverage for the 'SimpleXMLRPCServer' module in the stdlib.
"""

description = """

Measure the number of lines executed by the unit tests included with
Python 2.6 for the 'SimpleXMLRPCServer' module, using figleaf or coverage
(see MeasuringCodeCoverage).  Add new tests that increase the code
coverage for this module to > 95%.  Submit a context diff (see
SubmittingPatches) and text or HTML files containing both the old and
new test coverage results.

Note that for SimpleXMLRPCServer, the '__main__' code is run in a
forked process, so code coverage may not be not accurately recorded.
However, there is still quite a bit of code -- especially
error-handling code -- that needs to be tested.
