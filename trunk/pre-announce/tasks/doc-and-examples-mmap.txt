Add examples to the 'mmap' module
"""

description = """
Add documentation and examples to the 'mmap' module in the Python 2.6 standard
library.

See DocumentationAndExampleGuidelines for general information on
getting the latest docs, editing them, and generating patches.

Details for this specific module:

Add an explicit example of using mmap on either Windows and Linux to
map a file into memory and then read from it and write to it.  In your
example, verify that the file is changed on disk.

Also add an explicit example of creating an anonymous mmap object, writing
to it, fork()ing another process, and then reading from the preserved
mmap object.

(Also see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mmap for more information.)
