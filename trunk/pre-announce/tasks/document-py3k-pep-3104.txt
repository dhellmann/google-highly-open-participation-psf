summary = """
Update the Py3K docs with changes from PEP 3104, 'nonlocal'.
"""

description = """
Many of the Python Enhancement Proposals (PEP) for Py3K, numbered 31xx,
have been accepted and implemented (see the PEP index, "Finished PEPs",

     http://www.python.org/dev/peps/

for a full list).  However, the changes in the code are not yet
reflected in the Python docs.  Read and understand the PEP, locate the
places in the docs that need to be updated, and update them to reflect
the changes in the PEP.

You can find the 'nonlocal' stub documentation in

    http://docs.python.org/dev/3.0/reference/simple_stmts.html

Rewrite text from the PEP to document the behavior of 'nonlocal' just
like 'global' (immediately above the stub).  Also add a section to the
tutorial demonstrating the use of 'nonlocal' and 'global'.

Reminder: working code examples are an excellent way to make sure that
you understood the PEP ;)

Completion:

Attach the results of an 'svn diff' (context diff) against the Python
source tree to this task, and send a brief description of your changes
to the ghop-python mailing list.
