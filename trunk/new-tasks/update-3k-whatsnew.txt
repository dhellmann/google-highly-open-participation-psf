Update the Python 3.0 "What's new" document.
"""

description = """
Each new version of Python has a "What's new" document in its documentation.
The one for the upcoming Python 3.0 has not been kept up to date.

Your task is to record as many non-trivial changes as possible in that
document, as far as they aren't already there, at least in the form of a
brief sentence. The important thing here is that the changes don't get
lost; no elaborate examples are needed for now -- the paragraphs can
be expanded later.

Many important changes are listed in PEP 3100 and the other 3xxx PEPs
marked as accepted or final; many more have been noted in the Misc/NEWS
file for the 3.0 branch. However, it would also be a good thing to go
through the commit messages for the branch to spot any notable changes
not mentioned in one of these sources.

Make sure the entries are properly split up in groups so that one can
easily find changes to a particular part of Python.

See the DocumentationAndExampleGuidelines and WorkingOnDocumentation wiki
pages for helpful information, under

   http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-psf/w/list

The PEPs can be found at http://www.python.org/dev/peps

Completion:

Attach the results of an 'svn diff' (context diff) against the Python
source tree to this task, and send a brief description of your changes
to the ghop-python mailing list.
