summary = """
Write a HOWTO on running existing Lib tests, and writing new unit/doctests.
"""

description = """
Write a HOWTO on running the existing tests, with and without code
coverage; see RunningPythonTests and RecordingTestCoverage for
inspiration, and regrtest.py's docstring for command line options.
Also include a section demonstrating how to add both unittests and
doctests for a fictitious new Library module, "foobar.py", to the
CPython core source.

While you're at it, fix 'Lib/test/regrest.py -h' so it actually outputs help.

Completion:

Attach HOWTO (in reStructuredText format) to this task, along with an
'svn diff' against the current trunk source tree for your regrtest.py
changes.
