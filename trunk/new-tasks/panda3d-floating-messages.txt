Implement floating messages for Panda3D.
"""

description = """
Panda3D is a 3D engine: a library of subroutines for 3D rendering and
game development. The library is C++ with a set of Python
bindings. Game development with Panda3D usually consists of writing a
Python program that controls the Panda3D library.

See http://code.google.com/p/python-panda3d-examples/.

For this task you will need to implement a common display mechanism,
one that temporarily displays a slowly floating message. Most often
the messages float upwards, change color as they move and/or fade out.

Create a program that loads up a model, then upon a keypress creates a
message and floats it upwards combining multiple effects (color,
transparency etc).

Recommendations: Use a text node and animate it via Intervals. Combine
multiple effects with Parallels or Sequences.

Completion:

Attach your source code with all necessary supporting files to this task.
Add a wiki page to the python-panda3d-examples wiki explaining your program.
