Write a nose plugin to support running the Python stdlib tests within nose.
"""

description = """
Reimplement the regrest functionality in a nose plugin.

This plugin should support loading the basic tests from the Lib/test/
directory and executing and reporting on the results, all from within
the nose framework.

For extra kudos, translate the existing regrtest.py tags into nose tags,
perhaps using pinocchio's decorator module.

Completion:

Attach the nose plugin and example output to this file.
