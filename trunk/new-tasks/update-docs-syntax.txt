summary = """
Update references to old Python syntax in the docs.
"""

description = """
In Python 3.0, many old syntax elements have been removed and will not
work anymore.  While the library code is kept up-to-date with respect
to these removals, the documentation is not always updated accordingly.
Therefore, examples in the docs might still use old syntax and not work
in 3.0 anymore.

Update the documentation for Py3K appropriately. This means grepping
(= searching) through the reST source files for occurrences of old
constructs and replacing them with their 3.0 equivalents. A list of
these constructs has been written as an earlier GHOP task, and is
available under

   http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-psf/downloads/list

as "26-30.txt".

See the DocumentationAndExampleGuidelines and WorkingOnDocumentation wiki
pages for helpful information, under

   http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-psf/w/list

Completion:

Attach the results of an 'svn diff' (context diff) against the Python
source tree to this task, and send a brief description of your changes
to the ghop-python mailing list.
