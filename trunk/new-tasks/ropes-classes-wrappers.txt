Write nice Python classes for PyPy Ropes algorithm
"""

description = """
See

  http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2007/11/ropes-branch-merged.html

Write Python classes that expose the ropes algorithms in PyPy as two classes,
one behaving as much as possible as the builtin str type, the other as the
builtin unicode type. Write unittests for these classes to check them for
correct behaviour.

The PyPy rope algorithms can be found here:

https://codespeak.net/svn/pypy/dist/pypy/rlib/rope.py

This doesn't involve any knowledge of PyPy, the classes written should be just
completely normal Python code.
