Write a tutorial about the new string formatting method, as described
by PEP-3101, of Python 3000
"""

description = """
Python 3000 provides a new and more flexible string formatting
interface. This interface will replace sooner or later the current '%'
string operator. To help users to make the transition, describe, in a
tutorial style, the new advanced string formatting of Python 3000.

Write a text or (preferably) a ReStructuredText document that
describes with specific examples the basic usage and feature of the
new advanced string formatting. The document should also describe how
to convert the old '%' string formatting to the new formatting
interface.

Completion:

Send the completed document to the ghop-python list.
