Adapt PyPy demos at http://play1.codespeak.net.

description = """

Adapt PyPy demos to be able to run a python tutorial (selected one
page, eventually more) with sandboxed pypy in order to prevent
unauthorized access.

A few definitions:

PyPy project - implementation of Python interpreter in Python itself,
providing few distinct features.

Sandboxing - Idea of controlling interpreter execution. PyPy has
sandboxing python interpreter which can be controlled from the outside
python process.

Play1 - demo application written partly as python web server and
partly in Restricted Python (the thing used to implement python
interpreter in PyPy itself) and translated to javascript, available at
http://play1.codespeak.net

The idea is to use play1 and sandboxing to create nice and interactive
python demo. This can be pypy specific (as there are some avaible on
the web page), but can be completely pypy-independent (just for
python).  If good enough, I think this might appear on the main python
web page as a nice demo. From student it requires using svn,
translating pypy and sticking pieces together (I can help a lot as
well as whole #pypy-dev on freenode).

Completion would mean that one page from tutorial is available as
interactive tutorial.
