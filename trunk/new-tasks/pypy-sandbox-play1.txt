summary = """
Adopt PyPy demos at http://play1.codespeak.net to be able to run
a python tutorial (selected one page, eventually more) with sandboxed pypy
in order to prevent unauthorized access.
"""

description = """
Few definitions:

PyPy project - implementation of Python interpreter in Python itself,
providing
few distinct features.

Sandboxing - Idea of controlling interpreter execution. PyPy has sandboxing
python interpreter which can be controlled from the outside python
process.

Play1 - demo application written partly as python web server and partly
in Restricted Python (the thing used to implement python interpreter in
PyPy itself) and translated to javascript, available at
http://play1.codespeak.net

The idea is to use play1 and sandboxing to create nice and interactive
python demo. This can be pypy specific (as there are some avaible on
the web page), but can be completely pypy-independent (just for python).
If good enough, I think this might appear on the main python web page as a
nice
demo. From student it requires using svn, translating pypy and
sticking pieces together (I can help a lot as well as whole #pypy-dev on
freenode).

Completion would mean that one page from tutorial is available as
interactive
tutorial
