Write an reStructuredText plugin for Crunchy.
"""

description = """
Crunchy takes an html Python tutorial and transforms it into an interactive
session within a browser.  However, whereas html documents are very common,
their syntax tend to be a little bit tedious to write without making mistakes
using simple text editors.  Many Python programmers prefer to write documents
using reStructuredText (rst) and use docutils to transform rst document into
html ones.

Write a plugin for Crunchy that uses docutils to read in an rst document,
transforms it into an html one (preferably in-memory, i.e. without actually
creating a separate file) without any special markup,
and passes it back to Crunchy (vlam.py) for further processes as usual.  
You will also need to make minor changes to vlam.py to make this work.

You can download Crunchy from

http://code.google.com/p/crunchy

and docutils from

http://docutils.sourceforge.net/

Completion:

Attach your plugin (rst.py) and the modified vlam.py, as well as a sample
rst file that you use for test.  You have 5 days after you claim this task to complete it.

Bonus points: include a doctest-based test file (test_rst.txt) that (unit) tests
all the functions you have included in your plugin.  Look at the tests directory
of the Crunchy distribution for examples.
