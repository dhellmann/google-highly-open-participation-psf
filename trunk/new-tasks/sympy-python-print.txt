description = """

SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics:

http://code.google.com/p/sympy/

download it, play with it.

Write a function, that will accept a SymPy expression and it will
return a string, that can be
evaluated in Python using the eval() function that will produce the
original expression. Example:

print_python(x**2+y)

would print

x = Symbol("x")
y = Symbol("y")
e = x**2+y

More information here:

http://code.google.com/p/sympy/issues/detail?id=81

Please join the SymPy mailinglist (see the webpage) and ask any
questions you might have about SymPy in there.
