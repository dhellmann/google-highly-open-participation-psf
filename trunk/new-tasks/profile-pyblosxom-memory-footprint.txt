Install PyBlosxom 1.4.2.  Create a blog with 250 entries in it spread 
out across 10 categories.  The entries should be well-formed PyBlosxom 
entries, but they can contain gibberish text (if you want, use the text 
of this task wrapped in <p> ... </p>).  Using the default blog properties 
is fine.  There's no need to install any plugins.

Using techniques described in that article (particularly the mem_usage.py
script), investigate PyBlosxom's memory footprint in the following scenarios:

  - running as a CGI script
  - running as a WSGI application with Paste
  - running PyBlosxom as a static renderer

Details for installing and using PyBlosxom in these three modes are in
the PyBlosxom documentation.

Write a report containing the setup used (version of Python, operating
system, how you produced the entries, ...), the data produced by your 
investigation as well as any additional observations, conclusions 
and suggestions for making PyBlosxom run better.

The report should be written using restructured text.

Completion:

Send the completed document to the ghop-python list.
