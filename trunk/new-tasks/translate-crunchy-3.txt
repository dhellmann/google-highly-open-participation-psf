Add translation in a new language for Crunchy.
"""

description = """
Crunchy's messages are available in both French and English.  Provided
that you have a high fluency in another language, translate Crunchy's
messages into that language, using a UTF-8 encoding.  You may want to
use poedit to help you accomplish this task. Ask for help if you need
a starting point.  You can download Crunchy from

http://code.google.com/p/crunchy

When you claim this task, you must specify the language in which you
are translating the messages and make sure no one is attempting a
translation in the same language.

Bonus points: Make a screenshot showing Crunchy in action with your
language used as the default.  Ask one of your teacher (fluent in your
chosen language) to go over the translation and write the owner of
this task with an evaluation as to the quality of your translation.

Completion:

Attach a '.po' file for your language to this task.
