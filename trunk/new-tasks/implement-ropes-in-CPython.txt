summary = """
Implement a 'ropes' datatype for CPython in C.
"""

description = """
'ropes' represent strings using concatenation trees; see

   http://www.cs.ubc.ca/local/reading/proceedings/spe91-95/spe/vol25/issue12/spe986.pdf

and

  http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2007/11/ropes-branch-merged.html

At a minimum implement string concatenation, slicing, repetition, and
search/replace.  Build this either as a straight C/C++ extension type,
or as a Python wrapper around a C module.  Provide automated tests and
a setup.py/distutils file.

For extra extra credit, implement a unicode version too (py 2.6;
'bytes' and 'str' for py 3k).

Completion:

Attach a .tar.gz or zip file to this issue and send an e-mail to the
mailing list.
