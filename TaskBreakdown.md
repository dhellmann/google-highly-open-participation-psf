Whether or not you're new to programming or even to programming in
Python, there are a variety of tasks for you to tackle.

One good place to start is with the [demo and advocacy tasks](http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-psf/issues/list?q=label:demo), where you can run through an existing tutorial and then give a presentation on it.  You could also try [making a screencast](http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-psf/issues/list?q=label:screencast), where you record a video from your screen.

You can also work on [the Python core distribution](http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-psf/issues/list?q=label:core) or on a variety of [applications and libraries written by others](http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-psf/issues/list?q=label:thirdparty).

Testing code is a great way to get to know the code.  We have lots of
[testing tasks](http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-psf/issues/list?q=label:test); ask for guidance if you need a place to start.  Some of the [coverage tasks](http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-psf/issues/list?q=label:coverage) might be especially good.

The Python standard library ("stdlib" for short) is full of great functionality, and we have a bunch of [stdlib tasks](http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-psf/issues/list?q=label:stdlib) like writing new examples and updating documentation.

Speaking of documentation and examples, there are plenty of places that need work -- see the [documentation tasks](http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-psf/issues/list?q=label:docs) or the [examples tasks](http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-psf/issues/list?q=label:examples).

Do you know a language other than English?  Take a look at [the translation tasks](http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-psf/issues/list?q=label:translation).

We have a few [UNIX](http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-psf/issues/list?q=label:unix) and [Windows](http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-psf/issues/list?q=label:windows) tasks.

Know how to program in C or C++?  We have a [few tasks especially for you](http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-psf/issues/list?q=label:C)!

Interested in speed and performance issues?  Check out the [performance tasks](http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-psf/issues/list?q=label:performance).

The next big version of Python is "Python 3000", a.k.a. "Python 3K" or "Python 3.0".  We have a [few tasks](http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-psf/issues/list?q=label:py3k) related to making Python 3K a success!
