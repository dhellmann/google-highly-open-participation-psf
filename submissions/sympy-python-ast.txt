SymPy - simplify internal parser using Python AST
"""

description = """

SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics:

http://code.google.com/p/sympy/

download it, play with it.

Simplify internal parser by using Python AST

http://code.google.com/p/sympy/issues/detail?id=440

There is a proof-of-concept, and just waiting for someone brave to come
and finally implement it. Looks difficult, but it actually isn't -
take the patch
in the issue above,
then refactor the old parsing module from sympy/core/parser.py to
sympy/utilities/parser.py
and use the new in sympy/core/basic.py (sympify)

Make sure all the tests in SymPy pass (they should with the patch above).

Please join the SymPy mailinglist (see the webpage) and ask any
questions you might have about SymPy (or about this issue) in there.
