Graphics capture for the chuzer project.
"""

description = """

The chuzer project (http://chuzer.org/) is an attempt to provide
severely disabled computer users with a mechanism that allows them to
indicate choices. The idea is that a helper can trigger the program to
run with a specific set of choices, and the user can then indicate
their choice by selecting one of up to six graphics displayed on the
screen.

Please modify the existing choice code so that loadgrid() loads a set
of six images for a choice from a given directory on disk, scaling
them appropriately. The directory should be a command-line argument to
the choice program.

Completion:

Create a patch file with svn diff based on the trunk version of chuzer
and attach it with a comment on this ticket.
