Add support for the 're' module using PCRE
"""

description = """
Download and install Shed Skin, and read the included README for usage
instructions:

   http://shedskin.sourceforge.net

Especially read the part about how to implement libraries. Have a look
at the lib/ directory for examples of several standard library module
implementations.

Download and install PCRE, the Perl-Compatible Regular Expression
library:

http://www.pcre.org

Using PCRE, add support for basic 're' functionality (i.e., add lib/
re.py and lib/re.?pp), and illustrate the compatibility between 're' and
PCRE by compiling a test program that uses most basic 're' features.

You'll need to have experience with C to pull this off!
