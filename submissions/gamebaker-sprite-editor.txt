Create sprite editor for Game Baker.
"""

description = """
Game Baker is a graphical game development system in python.
http://code.google.com/p/game-baker/

we would like you to create a simple gui sprite editor for Game Baker.

Sprites (animations) are saved in Game Baker as instances of
game.Sprite
 
frames of the animation are often held in a single sprite sheet
(image), one frame next to another. These frames are saved in
the list Sprite.imagefiles

(example of creating a sprite from the platform demo)
{{{
    sprite = game.Sprite()
    # The images are in one file, going downwards
    sprite.imagefiles.append({"filename":"images/flag_sprite.bmp",
"topleft":(4,4), "bottomright":(37,41)})
    sprite.imagefiles.append({"filename":"images/flag_sprite.bmp",
"topleft":(4,52), "bottomright":(37,89)})
    sprite.imagefiles.append({"filename":"images/flag_sprite.bmp",
"topleft":(4,100), "bottomright":(37,137)})

    # update the sprite frame every two game frames
    sprite.framerate = 2

    # Set the Alpha (transparent) colour to Red (255,0,0)
    sprite.alphakey = (255,0,0)
}}}

you should use glade (glade.gnome.org),gtk or pygame. It will 
require some experience with whichever you use.

The application should be able to:
-open a pickled instance of game.Sprite with pickle.load()
-create a new instance of game.Sprite
-open images
-allow the user to select/modify frame areas and alpha colour
-save the Sprite instance using pickle.dump()


completion criteria:
- uses glade / gtk / pygame
- can create a new Sprite() instance
- can load images and modify frame regions
- can modify alpha colour
- can save the instance to disk with pickle
- give game-baker permission to release your code under both the GPL and LGPL.

(it is highly recommended that only people with some basic
experience of glade / gtk / pygame attempt this task)
