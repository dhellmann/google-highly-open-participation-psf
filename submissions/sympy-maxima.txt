"""


SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics:

http://code.google.com/p/sympy/

download it, play with it.

Implement Maxima parser

http://code.google.com/p/sympy/issues/detail?id=161

So that it is easier to try SymPy for those CAS users.

Implement just implement basic arithmetics and functions parsing, like

x+y+sin(x)**y etc.

(This is enough to fix this issue. If you are interested in writing a full
parser, let's discuss it on SymPy mailinglist and create a new issue for that.)

Please join the SymPy mailinglist (see the webpage) and ask any questions you
might have about SymPy in there.
