# Add a document on using Python on Windows #

Author: Georg Brandl

We have a document on using Python on the Mac, an equivalent thing for Windows
would be great. I would like that section to contain, roughly,
information how to install Python on different platforms, how to
configure it, how to invoke it, what extra things and quirks you
should know about, etc.
