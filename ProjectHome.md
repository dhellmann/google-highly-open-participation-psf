# Welcome to Python's Project for the Google Highly Open Participation Contest! #

[Python](http://www.python.org) is a dynamic object-oriented programming language that can be used for many kinds of software development.  It is also [open source](http://www.opensource.org/), which means that you (and everyone else!) can freely download, modify, and redistribute the source code for Python.

The Google Highly Open Participation ("GHOP") contest is an effort by Google to get secondary and high-school students involved in Open Source software.  You can read more about the reasons why they want to do this [here](http://code.google.com/opensource/ghop/2007-8/).  The bottom line, however, is that Google will award you, the student, prizes (including money) for completing tasks that involve working on Python!

If you're a student and you want to learn more about Python and see what kinds of tasks there are, go to the
[GHOP student page](StudentPage.md).

If you are a Python community member, you are welcome to [suggest new tasks](NewTaskGuidelines.md) and to help mentor
students!  Please go to [the mentor page](MentorPage.md) to join us!

If you have any trouble at all using this project, please contact [Titus Brown](mailto:titus@idyll.org).
