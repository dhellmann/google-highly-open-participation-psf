Write a Python cookbook recipe reading script that lists the modules imported.
"""

description = """
The Python Cookbook is a compilation of interesting and useful recipes in
Python.  Write a script that takes the text version of a cookbook recipe,
executes it, and lists the modules imported by that cookbook recipe.

Note that it doesn't need to support 3rd party modules that may not
be installed; it only needs to support standard Python modules.

For extra kudos, make it minimally robust to importing modules that don't
actually exist on the system you're running.  (See the __import__ hook
stuff.)

Completion:

Test your script on 10 different Cookbook scripts that actually import
modules.  Attach files containing some sample output and the script itself
to this task.  E-mail the ghop-python list.
