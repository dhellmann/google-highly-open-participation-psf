Write at least 5 detailed task suggestions around pygame/pgu/pug.

These can include

 - adding needed documentation to these packages,

 - new game ideas,

 - game rewrite ideas,

 - ideas for new functionality.

We strongly suggest discussing your ideas on the ghop-python list
before committing to writing them up in detail; it's your
responsibility to make sure that the tasks are reasonable!  (Warning:
we know some pygame programmers, and we are not afraid to consult with
them.)

Also note that you will be ineligible to work on the tasks that you write,
for legal reasons.

Completion:

Send your final task suggestions to the ghop-python mailing list and
allow discussion for 24 hrs.  Revise according to suggestions and
attach to this task, along with a pointer to the ghop-python thread.
