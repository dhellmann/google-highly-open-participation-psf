Create new rst directives for Crunchy.
"""

description = """
Crunchy takes an html Python tutorial and transforms it into an interactive
session within a browser.  While Crunchy can work with regular html documents,
it produces better results when VLAM (Very Little Additional Markup) is used
as special attributes to the html tags.  You can read about VLAM in the
Crunchy tutorial.

However, whereas html documents are very common,
their syntax tend to be a little bit tedious to write without making mistakes
using simple text editors.  Many Python programmers prefer to write documents
using reStructuredText (rst) and use docutils to transform rst document into
html ones.

docutils can make use of 'directives' to add special markup to files.
Create new 'directives' so that rst documents can incorporate the equivalent
of VLAM, i.e. docutils could make use of these new directives to transform
the rst document into an html one with the appropriate VLAM attributes.

You can download Crunchy from

http://code.google.com/p/crunchy

and docutils from

http://docutils.sourceforge.net/

You can read about creating new rst directives here:

http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/howto/rst-directives.html

Completion:

Attach your directives file, as well as a sample
rst file that you use for test.  You have 5 days after you claim this task to complete it.
