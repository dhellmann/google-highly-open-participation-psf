Add examples to the 'SocketServer' module.

description = """

Add documentation and examples to the 'SocketServer' module in the Python
2.6 standard library.

See DocumentationAndExampleGuidelines for general information on
getting the latest docs, editing them, and generating patches.

Details for this specific module:

 - write simple examples for SocketServer.TCPServer and UDPServer, showing
   both the client and server sides, and sending at least two messages
   back and forth.  (Make sure your code works ;)

 - show how to use ForkingMixIn and ThreadingMixIn to build asynchronous
   handlers.

Add these examples in a separate 'examples' section.

Completion:

Attach the results of a 'svn diff' (context diff) against the Python
source tree to this task in a comment, and send an e-mail briefly
describing the changes you made to the ghop-python mailing list.
