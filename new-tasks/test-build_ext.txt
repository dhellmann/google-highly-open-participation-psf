Write unit test for Python's distutils build_ext and compilers
"""

description = """
distutils is Python's infrastructure for distributing 3d party extensions. Parts
of distutils aren't covered with tests yet. An important part of the distutils
is the build_ext command and the compilers. They provide an unified interface
to compile C and C++ extension on all supported platforms with a large list of
compilers.

Write a small unit test that compiles a small C extension with distutils in a
temporary directory. Verify that the extension can be loaded and has all
its attributes and functions. After the test unload the extension and remove
the temporary data.

The C extension for the test is already included in the Python source tree.
Compile Modules/xxmodule.c as xx.

Completion:
- a svn diff against the trunk
- a successful test run on at least one of the three major platforms Linux, Mac or Windows

assistance for Windows users.
