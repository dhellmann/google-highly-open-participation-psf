summary = """
Write a new restructured text formatter plugin for PyBlosxom based on
the old restructured text entryparser plugin.
"""

description = """
PyBlosxom 1.4 and previous versions had entryparsers which would format 
file-based entries that had a specified extension.

For example, the restructured text entryparser would open files that ended 
in .rst, parse the contents, convert the body of the entry from restructured 
text to HTML, and return the resulting title, metadata, and HTML body.

PyBlosxom 2.0 will have formatters which allow people to write formatting 
plugins that aren't restricted to parsing files.  Formatters take the body of 
an entry and convert it from some markup (reST, Markdown, some wiki markup, 
...) into HTML.

PyBlosxom 2.0 (which is still under development) is in SVN trunk in the
PyBlosxom SVN repository.

Entryparsers for PyBlosxom 1.4 are in SVN here:

http://pyblosxom.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/pyblosxom/trunk/contrib/entryparsers/

There are more details on the format callback in "Formatters and entry parsers 
specification" in the wiki here:

http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Formatters_and_entry_parsers_specification

The goal of this task is to write, document and test a new restructured text
formatter plugin.

Note: If you notice any problems with either the specification or the proposed
architecture while you're writing the plugin, let me (will.guaraldi@gmail.com)
know.


Completion:

Attach the new restructured text formatter plugin to this task.
