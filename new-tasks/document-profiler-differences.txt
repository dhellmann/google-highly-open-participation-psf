summary = """
Document the differences between the profilers available in the
standard library.
"""

description = """
Python's standard library currently provide three similar profilers --
i.e., cProfile, profile and hotshot. While each profiler has its own
strengths (and weaknesses), keeping them all increases the
maintenance burden of Python core developers. Therefore, the future
version of Python, Python 3000, will provide a single and universal
profiler to its users.

Write a document that describes as many as possible differences that
exists between the three profilers. Types of difference includes (but
not restricted to) features, interface (API), performance, and bugs.
Searching the mailing list archives and issue tracker for differences
discovered by other users is recommended.

Bonus marks if you comes up with specific examples of the differences.

Completion:

Send the completed document to the ghop-python list.

Relevant pages:
