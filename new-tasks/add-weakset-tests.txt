summary = """
Add tests for the weakref.WeakSet class in Python 3.0
"""

description = """
Python 3.0 has a new 'weakref.WeakSet' class, a set which only weakly
references its members.  There is a unit test for set types, in
'Lib/test/test_set.py', but it can't be applied to WeakSet because
it uses string elements, which in turn can't be weakly referenced.

Factor out new a set test base class that can be used for set, frozenset
and WeakSet, and appropriate subclasses that test the peculiarities of
set, frozenset and WeakSet. The existing classes should give you an idea
of how to generalize them.

Completion:

Attach the results of an 'svn diff' (context diff) against the Python
source tree to this task. Also include text containing the old and new
code coverage numbers and a brief description of the changes you've made.
