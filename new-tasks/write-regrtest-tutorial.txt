Write a HOWTO on running existing Lib tests, and writing new unit/doctests.

description = """

Write a HOWTO on running the existing tests for Python, with and
without code coverage; see RunningPythonTests and
RecordingTestCoverage for inspiration, and regrtest.py's docstring for
command line options.

Also include a discussion of best practices for writing unit tests for
CPython source (e.g., have a '__main__' section, have a test_main()
method, group tests in a reasonable fashion, don't repeat tests in
separate test files, etc).  Use the xxsubtype module as an example if
needed.

See the README kept with CPython's unit tests (Lib/test/README from
svn) and most doctest/unittest-based tests from the CPython test suite
for inspiration.

While you're at it, fix 'Lib/test/regrest.py -h' so it actually outputs help.

Completion:

Attach HOWTO (in reStructuredText format) to this task, along with an
'svn diff' against the current trunk source tree for your regrtest.py
changes.
