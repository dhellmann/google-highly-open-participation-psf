Create a visible coordinate system for Panda3D.
"""

description = """
Panda3D is a 3D engine: a library of subroutines for 3D rendering and
game development. The library is C++ with a set of Python
bindings. Game development with Panda3D usually consists of writing a
Python program that controls the Panda3D library.

See http://code.google.com/p/python-panda3d-examples/.

Initially one of the most confusing aspects of 3D programming consist
of not being able to tell the orientation and location of objects in
the 3D space. Create a visible coordinate system that shows all three
axes and displays labels on them.

Recommendations: you may need to create a simple 3D model (a cylinder)
that will be used (scaled and rotated) as an axis. You may use
MilkShape to easily create such a model. Use text nodes to display the
labels. Tip: the coordinate system in Panda3D is a right handed z-up
coordinate system -> X is to the right, Y is into the screen, and Z is
up.

Completion:

Attach your source code with all necessary supporting files to this task.
Add a wiki page to the python-panda3d-examples wiki explaining your program.
