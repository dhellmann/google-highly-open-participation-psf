Write a link checker for the Python documentation tools
"""

description = """
The Python documentation contains many external links, which are
always a maintenance burden since they may change or disappear.

Extend the documentation tools (Sphinx) with a link checker that
can be run over the docs and used to find broken links.

The documentation toolset is available in Subversion at

    http://svn.python.org/projects/doctools/trunk/sphinx

It converts the reST sources of the documentation to HTML, LaTeX
or similar output formats. To add the link checker, it will be
easiest to add a new "builder" that doesn't write output files,
but goes through the parsed input files for external links and
outputs a summary of intact and broken links.

There exist several link checkers for Python, so you can likely
adapt most of the code from one of them.

You will likely have more questions about Sphinx while doing
this task, so just ask Georg Brandl over IRC or email anytime.

Completion:

Attach the source code itself, as a patch file.
