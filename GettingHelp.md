# Getting Help #

Running into problems?  Confused about the task details?  Need to talk to someone?

There are a bunch of resources out there for you to use!

## Contest specific helplins ##

First, consider e-mailing the [ghop-python project mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/ghop-python) with your questions.  A group of friendly Pythonistas (see list of mentors, below) is standing by!

You can also use [Internet Relay Chat, or IRC](http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/new2irc.html); use an IRC client to connect to chat.freenode.net, channel #python-ghop.  We will try to hang out there.

Finally, please feel free to e-mail the task owner or 'CC' person directly.

## General Python community ##

The Python community is very friendly and can be a great source of information.
Check out the [list of community resources](http://www.python.org/community/)!

In particular, you should consider posting questions to the [general python mailing list](http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-list).  If you post to this list, please do identify yourself as "participant in the Google Highly Open Participation contest" and be sure to identify the task you're working on -- that way people can give you more detailed help.
