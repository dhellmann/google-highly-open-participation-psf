# General guidelines on writing documentation #

(Note that there are additional rules for [working on the core Python documentation](WorkingOnDocumentation.md) and [writing examples for the core Python distribution](WritingExampleCode.md).)

Documentation for any Python package or tool, including third-party packages, should be written in English and formatted in
[reStructuredText](http://docs.python.org/dev/documenting/index.html), which can be written
in any word processor or editor.

Examples for any Python package or tool, should be formatted as in WritingExampleCode.  We strongly encourage contributions that can be run with doctest.
