Do a gcov analysis of the CPython modules when running the tests.
"""

description = """
'gcov' is a coverage analysis program for the GNU C compiler,

   http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html

Compile CPython with gcov enabled, run all of the tests with regrtest.py,
and write a preliminary report analyzing the coverage of a few of the
importable modules in Modules/.

Note that this would ordinarily be straightforward, but gcov does not
supported shared libraries.  So, you'll have to figure out how to compile
all of the CPython Modules/ into the final python binary.

(Do this on Linux.  Don't take this task unless you're familiar with
Linux compilation nastiness, configure, and Makefiles!  Ask for help.)

Completion:

Write a HOWTO in reStructuredText format and attach it, together
with a few gcov reports, to this task.
