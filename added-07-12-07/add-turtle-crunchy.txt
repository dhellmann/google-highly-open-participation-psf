Write a simple turtle graphics module for Crunchy.
"""

description = """
Crunchy can make use of the <canvas> tag to create graphics interactively
on a page inside Firefox.  There are two modules that can be used
for this: graphics.py and math_graphics.py; the difference between
these two modules is the orientation of the positive y axis.

Using math_graphics.py as your inspiration, write a simple turtle
module for Crunchy.  The minimum functions you should include are: 
forward(), backward(), goto(), left(), right(), pen_up(), pen_down(), 
set_color() == set_colour(), circle(), init_graphics().  
In addition, you must write an html page that includes these 
functions inside a <pre> element that could be used as a sample page for Crunchy.

You can download Crunchy from

http://code.google.com/p/crunchy

To complete this task, in addition to being familiar with Python,
you will need to know some basic javascript.  You will also
need to know some basic trigonometry (sine and cosine).

You may find it useful to have a look at the canvas tutorial at
http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Canvas_tutorial

Time to complete: you must complete this task within 5 days (120 hours) of
having claimed it.  An extension of a few days is possible if you show
that you have made some significant progress.

Bonus points: Implement other useful turtle functions than those listed above.

Bonus points: While your "turtle" only needs to draw lines on the screen,
you will get bonus points if you load a turtle image that moves on the
screen with the pen.  This image need not change orientation.

Big bonus points: Have it set up so that the image of the turtle
rotates so that it always points in the direction where it is moving.
(I do not know if this is possible with a single image using the javascript canvas
inside Firefox.)

Completion:

Attach your module (turtle.py) and the html sample page (turtle.html),
and possibly an image (turtle.png).
