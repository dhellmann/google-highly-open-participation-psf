Implement an auto-start SCGI ability.
"""

description = """
Implement the idea described here,

   http://blog.ianbicking.org/2007/08/03/fast-cgi-that-isnt-fastcgi/

Please implement it in C, and test it aganst one of the Python SCGI servers.

Notes:

There's also already a cgi2scgi script in the scgi sources,
which does all the SCGI stuff and just needs process management added to
it.  The script is short and doesn't have any dependencies other than
the stdlib, so it's easy to work with.

A cool way to lay it out would be with a #! like:

  #!/path/to/cgi_starter
  start_process = server_start_script
  socket = scgi.sock

etc., so the configuration would itself be the CGI script, with the
actual gateway being the interpreter.

Completion:

Attach the source code itself, with documentation and examples, to this
task.
