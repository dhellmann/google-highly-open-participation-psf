Add documentation and examples to the 'difflib' module in the Python
2.6 standard library.

See DocumentationAndExampleGuidelines for general information on
getting the latest docs, editing them, and generating patches.

Details for this specific module:

 - write doctest examples for 'unified_diff' and 'context_diff'

 - import the Tools/scripts/diff.py example into the docs, simplifying
   as appropriate.

Completion:

Attach the results of a 'svn diff' (context diff) against the Python
source tree to this task in a comment, and send an e-mail briefly
describing the changes you made to the ghop-python mailing list.
