(Re-)write a log parsing module from Perl into Python.
"""

description = """
Provide a Python implementation of asql,

   http://www.steve.org.uk/Software/asql/

using sqlite and cmd.

Bonus points for writing/including a generic Apache log file parser in
pyparsing.

Kudos for any disparaging remarks you make about Perl in the source code
itself (but be polite and factual).

Completion:

Attach the source code itself, with documentation and examples, to this
task.
