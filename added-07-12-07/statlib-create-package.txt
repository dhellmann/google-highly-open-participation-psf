Combine multiple statistics modules into a single package.
"""

description = """
The goal of the project is to combine several python statistics modules 
into a single package.

See http://python-statlib.googlecode.com

Combine the statistical modules stats.py, pstat.py (testing files statstests.zip) and matfunc.py into a 
single package called statlib. Write a distutil based setup script (setup.py) that 
can be used to install the package in the standard way (python setup.py install). 
Make your setup script able to publish this package via the Python Package Index.
Write a wiki page on this site that lists the functions available in stats.py and matfunc.py. 

Recommendations: Target modules stats.py, pstat.py, statstest.zip can be 
found at http://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/Neural_Systems_Group/gary/python.html. The 
matfunc module can be found at http://users.rcn.com/python/download/python.htm

For details on distributing python modules see: http://docs.python.org/dist/dist.html

Attach your source code with all necessary supporting files to this task.
(You may also submit these files into the python-statlib subversion repository)
Add the wiki page listing the statistical functions implemented in the modules 
to the python-statlib wiki
