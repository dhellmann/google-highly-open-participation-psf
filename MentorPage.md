# Introduction #

We hope that the Python community will be actively involved in this contest!

We can use community help in a number of ways.

First, you can always subscribe to the [general mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/ghop-python) and help students with problems.

Second, you can **join the [mentors list](http://groups.google.com/group/ghop-python-mentors)** and submit new tasks and decide whether or not existing task goals have been met.

Whether or not you're on either of the lists, you're welcome to submit new task ideas.  Go check out our **[new task guidelines](NewTaskGuidelines.md)**!

Also, please welcome and encourage the student participants when you meet them in
the forums and  elsewhere. Answer their questions and give them good advice.  Note that you can add comments to the tasks if you have additional information that you think would be helpful!

## Keeping track of tasks ##

The general ghop-python-notify list may be a bit overwhelming.  IF you want to monitor a specific task, you can either add yourself to the Cc: field of a task, OR click on the `*` to monitor it.  You'll receive notifications when that task is changed, via e-mail.

(Make sure you have enabled notifications under http://code.google.com/hosting/settings.)
