summary = """
Add 8 new standard soy.materials classes
"""

description = """
Each material class inherits soy.materials.Material and sets a default 
ambient, diffuse, specularity, and shininess.  The colors should use the 
default soy.colors.* (or add new instances) and a brief pydoc string for each 
new material class should describe what it's intended to look like.

An example can be found at 
http://svn.pysoy.org/trunk/pysoy/src/materials/S.pxi

Examples for these default materials include Chrome, Flesh, Emerald, Granite, 
Copper, Obsidian, Snow, and Syrup.  Materials should cover a wide range of 
colors and shininess, student is given free reign to implement her/his own 
ideas.  Classes should be listed in alphabetical order and in files named by 
the first letter of their name (such as S.pxi).  See 
http://svn.pysoy.org/trunk/pysoy/src/colors/ for what this looks like.
