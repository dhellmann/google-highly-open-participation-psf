SymPy - implement XFAIL to work in py.test
"""

description = """

SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics:

http://code.google.com/p/sympy/

download it, play with it.

XFAIL: get it work in all modes in py.test:

http://code.google.com/p/sympy/issues/detail?id=389

How it works is explained in the issue above. Currently,
the XFAIL only works in serial mode in py.test (we use it
regularly in sympy). The parallel mode doesn't work and that
is the job in this task.

Please join the SymPy mailinglist (see the webpage) and ask any
questions you might have about SymPy in there.
